We present MiniGPT-3D, an efficient and powerful 3D-LLM that aligns 3D points with LLMs using 2D priors. It has only 47.8 M learnable parameters and is trained in just 26.8h on a single RTX 3090. MiniGPT-3D takes the first step in efficient 3D-LLM, we hope that MiniGPT-3D can bring new insights to this community.
