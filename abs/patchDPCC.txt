Our novel patchDPCC framework enhances point cloud compression by using a patch-based approach that maintains geometric integrity and leverages inter-frame similarities. It features a patch generation module for consistent point count across patches and a point-based model with feature transfer for improved feature quality. Evaluations on the MPEG 8i dataset demonstrate a 47.01% better compression ratio over PCGCv2 and V-PCC, and a 9% to 16% improvement over D-DPCC, with the fastest decoding speed in learning-based models.
